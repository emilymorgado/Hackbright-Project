JSON REVIEW

Itunes API returns json

in JS can load in as an object

string can also be used in Python as a dictionary

in the API talk

use the library to retreive JSON string
use python requests library to pull json in and make/get a dictionary

the library will do it for you

make a request to an API endpoint, that returns json that you want in your db, 

if we use the requests api to ask iturnes to return "watermelon" stuff, we get json, that we can treat like a dict if we look through the json

visual inspection is good

maybe need to import another library????

import requests

jdict = r.json()

num_results = jdict['resultCount']

for i in rante(num_results):
    trackName = jdict['results'][i].get('trackName')
    artistName = jdict['results'][i].get('artistName')
