## Classyr.
Anyone can teach and anyone can learn. Classyr is the tool that connects teachers to locations and students. It's designed to connect people in a way that facilitates learning in person. This is not for online learning.

### Account Creation/Login
Teachers and students create different account types.

**Teachers can:**
- Create new classes
- Remove finished classes
- Hide reviews

**Teachers cannot:**
- Join/drop classes (unless they create a second account that's registered as a student)

**Students can:**
- Join/drop classes
- Rate and review classes
- Search and view existing classes

### Search page
On the right, you can browse newly created classes
On the left, using dropdowns, you can search for a specific class. These results are run through a non-linear, weighted, ranking algorithm that take into account, the following metrics:
- Student ratings
- Number of days until start date
- Price
- Number of days since class was created
- Max class size (number of students)
- If the class is already full or not
